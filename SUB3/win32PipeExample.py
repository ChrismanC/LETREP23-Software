#this is an example of pipes, in case you ever need to troubleshoot them.
#pipes are a method of communication between processes in windows.
#functions read and write to pipes almost (but not quite) like they are a file.
#if you write to a pipe without reading from it, a process may hang.
#if you read to a pipe that hasn't been written to, you may have an error.
#C++ gets weird about data types, but the python end is intuitive once you practice.
