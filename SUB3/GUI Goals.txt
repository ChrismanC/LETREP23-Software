By the end of the Fall semester, I would like...
1. The GUI to be completely useable. Aesthetic can come later. 
2. The GUI to be organized, not with buttons in random places, but most elements in their final position.
3. The GUI to be completely integrated with the backend code (Jesse's code).

Specific elements:
1. Start button
2. Pause button
3. Trash latest button
4. Preload display
5. Success record display
6. User info display (id, port?, sess#, block#)
